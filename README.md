# Basic Puppeteer Scraper

This project builds a list of dental practices and their contact information.

## Overview

The script scrapes data from [NPI No](http://www.npino.org/doctor/dental-providers/dentist-122300000X) to gather a list of dentists nationally. It then enters each record to retrieve detailed information and writes the data to a JSON file.

## Features

- Scrapes dental practices and contact information
- Writes data to a JSON file
- Can run in chunks or recursively process all data at once
